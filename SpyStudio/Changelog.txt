Use ShowLayerPaths to show registry paths also
Add option to MergeWow6432NodeValues on compare and normal
BUG: when executing from startup the number of hooks is less than hooking the 2nd time when the process is running (e.g.: Execute and hook with Com IE9 and then unhook and hook. Compare number of hooks of both).

TODO:
* DONE: Database Exception: when start hooking after loading a log.
* Verify why when there are tons of events the UI freezes.
* Change SortedNodeCollection insert to use binary search.
* Verify Check
* Verify Sort by version.
* Goto trace awful
* Blinking Properties
* No results search
* Search doesn't work all function trace.
* tab creation and remove BeginUpdate

* Remove block
* Remove until the end
* Reset removed blocks
* Properties all tabs except trace: expand all items shown: compare and normal.

* Exceptions: missing some callbacks (Kixxx)
* Test LZA extraction.

Failures:

* FIX: Big templates were generating memory exception.

v2.8.7
* Database performance improved.
* Refresh performance improved: events are reported async.
* Insert performance improved.
* Load log performance improved.
* Procmon logs conversion performance improved (about 3x).
* UI insertion performance and response improved: thread added to draw EventSummary control. 
* Processing events wasn't showing events that were waiting to be processed in UI.

* FIX: SpyStudio was unable to capture Internet Explorer 11.
* Export: Virtual Applications now can be updated without capturing them again, even when the package wasn't created using SpyStudio.
* DotNet Capture: SpyStudio can now troubleshoot .NET applications. You can see exceptions, assembly loads, object creation and much more.
* FIX: Compare memory consumption reduced about 60%.
* FIX: AutoSizeColumn on Trace Tree only iterates visible nodes making it very fast.
* Database refactoring: Stack information was moved to another database. Events are not serialized anymore. Performance improved in almost all operations: Load log, AddEvents, RefreshEvents, GetEvents. Refresh doesn't block db thread reducing refresh time to about 50%.
* Added a column 'Relevance' showing the Priority of the event.
* TreeViewNode: ParamMain now shows the first and last part of the path if it is too big to show the complete content.

* Compare traces has a summary of matches on the left side like text compare products  (more info: http://whiteboard.nektra.com/compare-traces).
* FIX: Double click on Trace was opening properties dialog even when the click was in an empty area or on the header.
* Compare trace now respects event generation order.
* Export wizard now saves user changes.
* CreateDialog was showing always error.
* FIX: After clearing events Trace control could have some problems in 'Go To event'.
* FIX: After clearing events Trace control could show incorrect scrollbar position.

* FIX: SpyStudio was sometimes losing events on application termination.

* FIX: Export File system and Registry vertical were too big to fit the panel. 
* FIX: When the TreeViewAdv's scrollbar was visible but the control wasn't visible, it could hide a row of the tree.
* Export to Swv fixed.
* About help link added to the Nektra's Wiki.

* FIX: Export to Swv doesn't have the isolation combo.
* FIX: Export to ThinApp: After changing isolation mode of a folder the row wasn't redrawn.
* RaiseException is not critical if there is a following ExceptionContinue.
* FIX: Big amount of pending events after clear.

* FIX: Applications which generates a big amount of events fast were consuming a lot of memory since the events were accumulated and then processed. Now they are processed while generating them.
* FIX: ThinApped Apps could have some problems with the embedded manifests (e.g.: MS Access).
* FIX: Failed events weren't appearing in File System.

* FIX: Export wizard F2 now let the user rename packages and Ctrl+N create a new package
