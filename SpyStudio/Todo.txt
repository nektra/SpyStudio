Bugs
* XP OpenFile is not hooked?
* XP Some registry operations are not hooked (RegCreate, some RegOpen and some RegQuery).
* Auto-size columns compare
* Hook FindFirst / FindNext / LoadTypeLib
* winspool.drv
* Add Memory functions and OpenProcess (malware)
* Implement .mui lock using FindResource
* Implement registry lookup for registry keys. When a clsid is searched first it tries to find it in HKCU then HKLM. 
Now, we show only one fail when there is an error and we show only the succeeded key when it is found. We should show all the queries. We may
hook Ntxx functions or implement logic.
* FindResource: it appears as a read access but when it fails it looks like the file open is failing. It should be another file access.
* Complement Localization:

* Clipboard
* IE6: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\{D30C1661-CDAF-11D0-8A3E-00C04FC9E26E}	-> TypeLib -> Version -> it's shown as binary while is REG_SZ
* Compare: Com tab: when server is different it shows only 1.
* W7 doesn't get all the registry queries in the CoCreates.
* Compare: Don't show %system32% as different C:\windows\System32 e.g.
* Add RegisterWindow and some others
* BUG: filter CreateWindow on Compare window show no results
* CoMarshalInterface and may be others
* Compare -> Find doesn't use last search by default
* Sometimes the process name is wrong when hooking with Context menu -> Hook
* LoadTypeLib oleauth
* ExitProcess and RaiseException
* CreateRemoteThread is called on XP and the address is wrong.
* RegQueryMultipleValues
* Unify errors
* CreateFileMapping
* Path in status bar for registry tab (like regedit)

* show item/s in trace
* Properties for non trace tabs
** Improve the REG_UNKNOWN when it fails. Put the type that the user asks.
* Add parameters to execute
* Registry handling: reduce memory usage and reuse buffers;
* Export: currently there is a workaround for Wow6432Node keys to export with 32bits paths. It should be done better.
* Compare logs without caller: this can be done but a new dictionary should be created based on path or other thing instead of caller.
* Compare: improve results in registry (%systemroot%\system32 == c:\windows\system32, c:\windows\SysWOW64 == c:\windows\system32)
TreeViewAdv
* When resizing TreeViewAdv columns the text resizes a bit weird.
* With ckeck boxes: check / uncheck using space bar -> exception (or kill selection with SpyStudio fix)

Export:
* Add options to create shortcuts.
* Add option to set a different Program Files directory.

FIX:
** Multiple registry replacements
** BUFFER TOO SMALL / NO MORE ENTRIES not an error
** Try to match with the same result before. Now a match with different result has the same priority of a match that matches result. This occurs with calls that return results until a NO MORE ENTRIES. We should try to match results too.
** e.Result == "NO MORE ENTRIES" || add NO MORE FILES
* Unify SUCCESS (e.g.: REPARSE and SUCCESS)
* Merge paths in trace
* Remove last '\' in files

FEATURES:
* CoCreate: add information about ProxyStub or Server. Complete item with the information collected from registry
